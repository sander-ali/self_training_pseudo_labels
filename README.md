# self_training_pseudo_labels
The repository provides the code for training a single and two classifiers for self training strategies with pseudo labels.

The data with semi-supervised nature is considered for the purpose of this demo. 

The code is based on the techniques provided in the study [Self-Training: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040) .

The implementation is quite straight forward. The comparison with the default classifier is also shown in the results below:
